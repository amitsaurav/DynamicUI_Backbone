Each UI document will consist of an array of sections, where a section corresponds to one of the settings boxes on our fulfillment page.  One section could be for 'region' another for 'VPC settings' etc.  Each section will have a name and also an array specifying what should be shown in that section (an array of widgets).  

Widgets are the smaller groups of html elements that will focus on providing the user with one piece of information.  For example:  we will have a widget for just displaying text to the user (for instructions), another widget that shows the available regions, another that shows a list of vpcs, another for subnets.  Each of those widgets can be designed separately using HTML and CSS for whatever type of appearance is needed.

Here is a piece of a document in Javascript:

var uidocument = 

                sections: [
                    { 
                        name: "Region",
                        widgets: [
                            {
                                type: "textBlock",
                                header: "Region instructions",
                                content: "Instructions, instructions, instructions"
                            },
                        ]
                    },
                    { 
                        name: 'VPC Settings', 
                        widgets: [
                                    {
                                        type: "textBlock",
                                        header: "Some instructions for filling out the VPC wizard",
                                        content: "Content"

                                    },
                                    {
                                        type: "vpc",
                                        name: "VPC",
                                        helpText: "",
                                        id: "vpc1",
                                    },
                                ]
                    }
                    ];


This will result in rendering two boxes on the page, the first will contain one widget (for showing text) and the next box will contain two widgets -- one for showing text another for showing vpc information.

The type of a widget is required.  The type is what determines which UI element will be rendered.
The next most important field is id.  The id is not required to render a UI element but if we should want to receive a user's input or selection from a widget, the id IS required.  It is also required if we want to refer to a widget from another widget.

For example retrieving a list of subnets depends on what vpc has been selected.  A subnet widget alone is not enough to display a list of subnets. To get a useful subnet widget it must refer to a vpc and this brings us to another important field (dependsOn).  If we want to add a subnet widget to the above document we would need to add a widget entry that looks something like this:

{
    type: "subnet",
    name: "Subnet",
    helpText: "",
    id: "subnet1",   //indicating we are interested in recording what the user selects in this widget
    dependsOn: "vpc1" // the id of the widget above that this subnet widget is tied to for its data
}

Currently, there is no validation for whether a dependsOn relationship makes sense.  For example we could make a subnet widget depend on a security group widget.  This doesn't make sense (a vpc is required to get a list of subnets not a security group) but at the moment the current design would result in a failure to load the data.  We could build in some validation such as ensuring that a subnet widget doesn't have a dependsOn relationship on anything but a vpc widget.

I will provide more information on the various widget type names.
